# Simple Markdown Parser powered by Elm

This project was worked on as part of CS4215 Programming Language Implementation, 
where we explored the Elm programming language and its ecosystem.

This parser covers a subset of the CommonMark specification of Markdown:

1. Headers
2. Blockquote (nested)
3. Unordered List (nested)
4. Italic (`*`)
5. Bold (`__`)

Building the web app:

```bash
elm-make App.elm
```
